# SaaF Android
![SaaF Android](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/374664892/2808cf99-1094-4c91-b785-1f695165bd2f)
<center>An app to view, listen and replace audio in an .osw file from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas mobile</center>
## How does this work
The audio files in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas mobile are basically just uncompressed ZIP archives.   
So it can be opened using a ZIP extractor like ZArchiver.   
Inside the archive are files with the name "Track_XXX.mp3", SaaF Android uses modified metadata from SaaF by Nick7 to translate their filenames into their proper titles.
## Features
- View the contents of the audio file
- Listen to the audio without extracting it
- Save the audio file to storage
- Create a new IDX file (Thanks to LSDsl)
- Replace the audio file (Coming Soon)
