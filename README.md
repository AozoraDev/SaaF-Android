## What is SaaF?
SaaF stands for San Andreas Audio Fixer. \
SaaF was first created by Nick7 in 2013 for PC with the aim of fixing GTA:SA Mobile radio files or creating IDX file for updated OSW file. \
\
I, [AozoraDev](https://github.com/AozoraDev), have a desire to create a "pocket" version of SaaF with additional features. \
And here it is, **SaaF Android**. \
\
**Note:** \
This app is still under development.
## Installation
As I said, the app is still under development but you can try the debug version which is updated every time there is a new commit. \
You can go to [Actions](https://github.com/Shumi-Project/SaaF-Android/actions), select the new commit, download the zip file in the artifact, then extract it.
## Contribution
Since [AozoraDev](https://github.com/AozoraDev) likes to copy-paste arbitrary code on Stackoverflow, you can do a contribution to improve this project. \
Of course! Your contribution will be very valuable for this project. \
\
How to contribution? \
You can do pull requests in the form of fixes or improvisations for this project. \
Support me through [Donation](#Donation) or join [Shumi Project discord server](https://discord.gg/nVXqAJD) also a contribution.
## Building
Just clone this repo then open your "Your CPU heater" aka Android Studio lol. \
\
Or if you like working with Notepad or something like that, you can type `./gradlew.bat assembleDebug` (for Windows) or `./gradlew assembleDebug` (for Linux) on your command line. \
Make sure you have OpenJDK 17 and Android-SDK installed (OpenJDK 11 can also be used as long as you delete the debug.jks file).
## Building (Termux)
You can also build this app on Android. \
Make sure you have [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) (F-Droid version, not Play Store version) and [Termux-NDK by Lzhiyong](https://github.com/Lzhiyong/termux-ndk) installed then type `bash build.sh` in Termux.
## Donation
For now, I only accept donation from Indonesian because i don't have Paypal. \
Why? Due to country age restrictions.
